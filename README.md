# Star Wars Character Search

This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for Star Wars characters, planets, films, species, vehicles, and starships and see associated characters with images using the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and Star Wars Visual Guide.

The project is divided into two parts: frontend and backend.

## Frontend

The frontend is a React application. To run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend

The backend is an Express server that handles API calls to SWAPI and fetches images from the Star Wars Visual Guide. To run the backend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.

The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:6001`.

Now, you can use the web application to search for Star Wars characters, planets, films, species, vehicles, and starships, and see associated characters with images.
